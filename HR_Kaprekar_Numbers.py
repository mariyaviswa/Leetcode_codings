"""
A modified Kaprekar number is a positive whole number with a special property.
If you square it, then split the number into two integers and sum those integers, you have the same
value you started with.
Consider a positive whole number n with d digits. We square n to arrive at a number that is either
2 x d digits long or (2 x d) - 1
digits long. Split the string representation of the square into two parts, l and r.
The right hand part, r must be d digits long. The left is the remaining substring.
Convert those two substrings back to integers, add them and see if you get n.

Example
-------
n = 5
d = 1
First calculate that n^2 = 25. Split that into two strings and convert them back to integers 2 and 5. Test 2 + 5 = 7 is != 5, so this is not a
modified Kaprekar number. If n = 9, still d = 1, and n^2 = 81. This gives us 1 + 8  = 9, the original n.

Note: r may have leading zeros.

Here's an explanation from Wikipedia about the ORIGINAL Kaprekar Number (spot the difference!):

In mathematics, a Kaprekar number for a given base is a non-negative integer, the representation of whose square in that base can
be split into two parts that add up to the original number again. For instance, 45 is a Kaprekar number, because 45^2 = 2025 and
20+25 = 45. """

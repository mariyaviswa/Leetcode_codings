"""
An English text needs to be encrypted using the following encryption scheme
First, the spaces are removed from the text. Let L be the length of this text.
Then, characters are written into a grid, whose rows and columns have the following constraints:

 root(L) <= row <= column <= root(L), where x is floor function and x is ceil function
 
Example
-------

s = if man was meant to stay on the ground god would have given us roots
After removing spaces, the string is 54 characters long.root(54) is between 7 and 8, 
so it is written in the form of a grid with 7 rows and 8
columns.
    i f m a n w a s
    m e a n t t o s
    t a y o n t h e
    g r o u n d g o
    d w o u t d h a
    v e g i v e n u
    s r o o t s
• Ensure that rows X columns > L
• If multiple grids satisfy the above conditions, choose the one with the minimum area, i.e. rows x columns.
The encoded message is obtained by displaying the characters of each column, with a space between column texts. The encoded
message for the grid above is:

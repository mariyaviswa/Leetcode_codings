"""
409. Longest Palindrome
-----------------------

Given a string s which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return the length of the longest
palindrome
 that can be built with those letters.

Letters are case-sensitive, for example, "Aa" is not considered a palindrome.

Example 1:
----------
Input: s = "abccccdd"
Output: 7
Explanation: One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.

Example 2:
---------
Input: s = "a"
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest palindrome that can be built is "a", whose length is 1.

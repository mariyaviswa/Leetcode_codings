11. Container With Most Water
-----------------------------

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that
the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

Example 1:
----------
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7].
In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

Example 2:
----------
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
